  # Rule 7 – Speak in English Only

This is an English-speaking server. All in-character and out-of-character communication must be in English.

Character accents are a built-in trait in Space Station 14 and are fully allowed. Accents may naturally cause altered spelling, phrasing, or pronunciation.

Limited non-English words or phrases are allowed only when they:
- Are produced through an accent trait (e.g., occasional foreign words, curses, or songs),
- Are not used to convey important information,
- Are not used to evade moderation or exclude other players from understanding ongoing roleplay.

Extended conversations, instructions, or information must always remain in English.
